ETEFS_Mini can encrypt those files containing sensitive data generated by the selected applications, such as Microsoft Word, Excel and Power Point. All files are stored in encrypted form on the disk. The encryption progress is executed at background on-the-fly, and does not change the normal operation behavior of the end user. It is easy to integrate ETEFS_Mini into your software product in a short development cycle. Besides of the core transparent file encryption functionality, ETEFS_Mini also provides some extension functionalities that are very useful in developing data security related software product, including a file access control module and an operation event monitor module. With the help of ETEFS_Mini, software developers can rapidly build various document security products from scratch, like DLP (Data Loss Prevent) system, document right management system and document operation auditing system, etc.
